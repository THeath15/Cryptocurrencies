# Cryptocurrencies
Overview: Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked  to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:
Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
