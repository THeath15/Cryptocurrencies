# Cryptocurrencies
Overview: Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked  to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:
Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

# Results: 

Data was first preprocessed by being cleaned, encoded, and scaled to more appropriately work with the algorithms.

We then used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the dataframe, for further analysis.

Visualizing Cryptocurrency Results
3D scatter plot using the PCA data. Transformed data for "Total Coin Supply" and "Total Coins Mined", which we then used to create a 3D scatter plot.
